# User Manual: @wowitsjerome

<aside>
💡 In stages of growth or storming within an organization, it's helpful to gain insight on the people you work with, how they prefer to work, and what methods are the best to communicate with them.  While this insight is really best captured over time through various interactions and experiences, the purpose of this user manual is to help jumpstart that process.
